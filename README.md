# Stock Prediction Research and Experimentation
Research and experimented on how to model and predict a stock's upcoming closing price. 

Initially researched through pure mathematics using concepts including:
- Modeling and regression of polynomial and trigonometric functions
- Derivatives using instantaneous rates of change
- Secants using average rate of change
- Volatility and risk using standard deviation
- Trigonometic functions and their features
- Coefficient of determination using r^2 to evaluate models
- Other methods of statistical analysis

Then, experimented with Python to expand such learning using:
- YFinance
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scripy.optimize
- Sklearn.metrics
